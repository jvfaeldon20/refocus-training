Algorithim
- a sequence of steps that is described in a written form. usually its easier to solve complex problem, if you try to illustrate it in a graphical form such as a graphical illustration called flowchart.
- a procedure usd to solve a problem or perform a computation

Syntax
- tells computer how to read the code. it includes rules on how to declare variables, work with them and punctuation to use.

3 types of algorithim
1. linear - step-by-step instruction
2. branched - helps to reflects scenarios 
(conditional based)

3. cyclic - one repeats one action multiple times
(include loop conditions)

Iteration 
- single execution of the loop code block


------------------------------------------------


Data types can be mutable or immutable
Immutable
- strings
- numbers
- booleans
- null
- undefined

Mutable - a type of variable that can be changed without creating an entirely new value
- arrays
- objects


------------------------------------------------


Function - a block of code that usually executes a task or some calculation. it accepts arguments as inputs in the parenthesis
and returns an output


function - keyword use to declare a function
return - keyword use to get get function output
local - variables are declared inside the function and can only be access inside the functions code block
conditional statement - not necessary to declare in a function



STRING METHODS
1. slice
var status = "world"
status.slice(1) = "w"


JavaScript methods - are predefined actions that can be called from an object to perform a task
arr.length = returns the number of chars in a string
arr.slice(0,5) = extracts a part of a string and return the string from p1(start index) - p2(end index)
arr.substring(0,3) = 




closures
- a function inside a another function
- helps us prevent unwanted user actions

callbacks
- functions that are passed as an argument to another function


memory lifecycle
1 - javascript allocates the memory that you need
2 - you used the allocated memory
