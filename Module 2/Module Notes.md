Algorithim
- a sequence of steps that is described in a written form. usually its easier to solve complex problem, if you try to illustrate it in a graphical form such as a graphical illustration called flowchart.
- a procedure usd to solve a problem or perform a computation

Syntax
- tells computer how to read the code. it includes rules on how to declare variables, work with them and punctuation to use.

3 types of algorithim
1. linear - step-by-step instruction
2. branched - helps to reflects scenarios 
(conditional based)

3. cyclic - one repeats one action multiple times
(include loop conditions)

Iteration 
- single execution of the loop code block
